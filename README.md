# 🌴 Days & Nights – Game Jam Project

**Days & Nights** is a small survival game made for the **Godot India Community Game Jam 2**.  
This was my **first ever game jam project**, created using the **Godot Engine**.

## 🎮 About the Game

You are stuck on an island and need to collect **7 wooden planks** to build a raft and escape.  
But there's a twist – you can **only carry one plank at a time**.  
To make things harder, the island is filled with **harmful crabs** that try to stop you.

Explore the island, survive the dangers, and escape before it’s too late.

## 🛠 How It Was Made

- Made with **Godot Engine 4.x**
- All assets, scenes, and gameplay were created by me during the jam
- I also used some **help from AI (ChatGPT)** to understand and write parts of the GDScript code

## 📦 Why a ZIP File?

I uploaded the full source code as a **.zip file** to preserve the original version I submitted for the jam.  
It includes all project files, scripts, scenes, and assets used to build the game.
